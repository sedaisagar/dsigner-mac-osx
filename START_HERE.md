# üöÄ START HERE - Event-Based System

Welcome! This document will get you up and running with the event-based Redis implementation in under 5 minutes.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

A complete **event-driven architecture** using Redis pub/sub that allows:
- Publishing events from your application
- Subscribing to events in separate processors
- Processing events asynchronously
- **Automatic Tkinter UI notifications** when events are received
- Publishing results to different topics

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `services/event_publisher.py` | Publish events to Redis |
| `services/event_subscriber.py` | Subscribe to events |

| `ui/event_dashboard_launcher.py` | **NEW:** Automatic UI notifications |
| `demo_events.py` | Demo & testing script |
| `test_redis_connection.py` | Connection validation |

## üéØ 3-Step Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Start Redis

```bash
# Install (if needed)
# Windows: choco install redis-64
# macOS: brew install redis
# Linux: sudo apt-get install redis-server

# Start Redis
redis-server
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the System

**Terminal 1** - Start processor:
```bash
python event_processor.py
```

**Terminal 2** - Publish events:
```bash
python demo_events.py
```

**Done!** You should see:
- Events being processed
- **Tkinter notification windows appearing automatically**
- Event details displayed in modal dialogs

## üß™ Test It Works

```bash
# Test Redis connection
python test_redis_connection.py

# Should show: ‚úì All tests passed!
```

## üíª Quick Code Examples

### Publish an Event

```python
from services.event_publisher import get_publisher

publisher = get_publisher()
publisher.publish_key_submitted("my_key", "My Token")
```

### Subscribe to Events

```python
from services.event_subscriber import EventSubscriber

subscriber = EventSubscriber()

def handle_event(topic, event_data):
    print(f"Got event: {event_data}")

subscriber.subscribe(['my_topic'], handle_event)

# Keep running
import time
while True:
    time.sleep(1)
```

---

## üîç Common Tasks

### Run Event Processor
```bash
python event_processor.py
```

### Publish Test Events
```bash
python demo_events.py
```

### Test Redis Connection
```bash
python test_redis_connection.py
```

### Run Your Main App
```bash
python main.py
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Connection refused  
**Fix**: Start Redis with `redis-server`

**Problem**: Module not found  
**Fix**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Problem**: Events not received  
**Fix**: Make sure `event_processor.py` is running
